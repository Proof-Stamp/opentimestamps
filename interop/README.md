# OpenTimestamps interoperability spike

This directory contains Phase 1 interoperability work for ProofStamp via Bitcoin.

The purpose is to prove standard `.ots` compatibility before any browser stamping UI or production network access is added.

## Upstream implementations pinned for the spike

- Canonical Python client: `opentimestamps/opentimestamps-client` at `cd71c7609421bed2a07b9642a3c02a58c9fd2cdf`
- OpenTimestamps TypeScript client: `opentimestamps/typescript-opentimestamps` at `12ba7b2c4f4cd1b8ce52d2c17be5efedca3bceab`, npm package `@opentimestamps/typescript-opentimestamps` `0.1.0`
- OTSkit core: `OTSkit/OTSkit-core` at `f0065a640db8b2ddbd7cb459c7f0cd4370693bd0`, npm package `@otskit/core` `0.2.0`

The TypeScript OpenTimestamps package and OTSkit are development-only interoperability oracles in this phase. Neither is selected as the production ProofStamp protocol dependency by this spike.

## What the automated tests prove

The test corpus is copied byte-for-byte from the canonical Python client's example fixtures at the pinned commit.

For supported valid fixtures, the Node test suite requires both JavaScript/TypeScript implementations to:

1. parse the standard detached OpenTimestamps file;
2. preserve the recorded file digest;
3. serialize the parsed proof back to exactly the same bytes.

For structurally invalid fixtures, the suite requires both implementations to reject them.

Fixture provenance, upstream blob IDs, byte lengths, and SHA-256 checksums are recorded under `tests/fixtures/opentimestamps/fixture-manifest.json`.

## What this does not prove yet

This spike does not yet prove:

- browser-created ProofStamp commitments can be stamped and accepted by the canonical Python client;
- calendar submission interoperability;
- upgrade interoperability;
- Bitcoin verification interoperability;
- production parser resource limits;
- production dependency or license suitability;
- production browser networking or CSP changes.

Those remain explicit gates. No user-facing stamping flow should be added merely because the fixture round-trip tests pass.

## Canonical Python check

The canonical fixtures remain the source of truth for this corpus. A separate canonical-Python CI check should be added before Phase 1 is declared complete. It should install the Python client from a pinned source commit, parse the valid corpus, reject the canonical invalid corpus, and cross-check any ProofStamp-generated `.ots` fixture.

Network-dependent calendar stamping and upgrading should not be made a required deterministic unit-test step. Networked interoperability tests should be isolated from the offline fixture suite.

## License note

`@opentimestamps/typescript-opentimestamps` is LGPL-3.0-or-later. `@otskit/core` is MIT. Their presence here as development-only test dependencies does not constitute a decision to ship either package in the browser product. Production dependency selection requires a separate security, maintenance, bundle, and license review.
